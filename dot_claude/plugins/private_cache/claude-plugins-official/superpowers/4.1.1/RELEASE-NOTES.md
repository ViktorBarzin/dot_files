# Superpowers Release Notes

## v4.1.1 (2026-01-23)

### Fixes

**OpenCode: Standardized on `plugins/` directory per official docs (#343)**

OpenCode's official documentation uses `~/.config/opencode/plugins/` (plural). Our docs previously used `plugin/` (singular). While OpenCode accepts both forms, we've standardized on the official convention to avoid confusion.

Changes:
- Renamed `.opencode/plugin/` to `.opencode/plugins/` in repo structure
- Updated all installation docs (INSTALL.md, README.opencode.md) across all platforms
- Updated test scripts to match

**OpenCode: Fixed symlink instructions (#339, #342)**

- Added explicit `rm` before `ln -s` (fixes "file already exists" errors on reinstall)
- Added missing skills symlink step that was absent from INSTALL.md
- Updated from deprecated `use_skill`/`find_skills` to native `skill` tool references

---

## v4.1.0 (2026-01-23)

### Breaking Changes

**OpenCode: Switched to native skills system**

Superpowers for OpenCode now uses OpenCode's native `skill` tool instead of custom `use_skill`/`find_skills` tools. This is a cleaner integration that works with OpenCode's built-in skill discovery.

**Migration required:** Skills must be symlinked to `~/.config/opencode/skills/superpowers/` (see updated installation docs).

### Fixes

**OpenCode: Fixed agent reset on session start (#226)**

The previous bootstrap injection method using `session.prompt({ noReply: true })` caused OpenCode to reset the selected agent to "build" on first message. Now uses `experimental.chat.system.transform` hook which modifies the system prompt directly without side effects.

**OpenCode: Fixed Windows installation (#232)**

- Removed dependency on `skills-core.js` (eliminates broken relative imports when file is copied instead of symlinked)
- Added comprehensive Windows installation docs for cmd.exe, PowerShell, and Git Bash
- Documented proper symlink vs junction usage for each platform

**Claude Code: Fixed Windows hook execution for Claude Code 2.1.x**

Claude Code 2.1.x changed how hooks execute on Windows: it now auto-detects `.sh` files in commands and prepends `bash `. This broke the polyglot wrapper pattern because `bash "run-hook.cmd" session-start.sh` tries to execute the .cmd file as a bash script.

Fix: hooks.json now calls session-start.sh directly. Claude Code 2.1.x handles the bash invocation automatically. Also added .gitattributes to enforce LF line endings for shell scripts (fixes CRLF issues on Windows checkout).

---

## v4.0.3 (2025-12-26)

### Improvements

**Strengthened using-superpowers skill for explicit skill requests**

Addressed a failure mode where Claude would skip invoking a skill even when the user explicitly requested it by name (e.g., "subagent-driven-development, please"). Claude would think "I know what that means" and start working directly instead of loading the skill.

Changes:
- Updated "The Rule" to say "Invoke relevant or requested skills" instead of "Check for skills" - emphasizing active invocation over passive checking
- Added "BEFORE any response or action" - the original wording only mentioned "response" but Claude would sometimes take action without responding first
- Added reassurance that invoking a wrong skill is okay - reduces hesitation
- Added new red flag: "I know what that means" → Knowing the concept ≠ using the skill

**Added explicit skill request tests**

New test suite in `tests/explicit-skill-requests/` that verifies Claude correctly invokes skills when users request them by name. Includes single-turn and multi-turn test scenarios.

## v4.0.2 (2025-12-23)

### Fixes

**Slash commands now user-only**

Added `disable-model-invocation: true` to all three slash commands (`/brainstorm`, `/execute-plan`, `/write-plan`). Claude can no longer invoke these commands via the Skill tool—they're restricted to manual user invocation only.

The underlying skills (`superpowers:brainstorming`, `superpowers:executing-plans`, `superpowers:writing-plans`) remain available for Claude to invoke autonomously. This change prevents confusion when Claude would invoke a command that just redirects to a skill anyway.

## v4.0.1 (2025-12-23)

### Fixes

**Clarified how to access skills in Claude Code**

Fixed a confusing pattern where Claude would invoke a skill via the Skill tool, then try to Read the skill file separately. The `using-superpowers` skill now explicitly states that the Skill tool loads skill content directly—no need to read files.

- Added "How to Access Skills" section to `using-superpowers`
- Changed "read the skill" → "invoke the skill" in instructions
- Updated slash commands to use fully qualified skill names (e.g., `superpowers:brainstorming`)

**Added GitHub thread reply guidance to receiving-code-review** (h/t @ralphbean)

Added a note about replying to inline review comments in the original thread rather than as top-level PR comments.

**Added automation-over-documentation guidance to writing-skills** (h/t @EthanJStark)

Added guidance that mechanical constraints should be automated, not documented—save skills for judgment calls.

## v4.0.0 (2025-12-17)

### New Features

**Two-stage code review in subagent-driven-development**

Subagent workflows now use two separate review stages after each task:

1. **Spec compliance review** - Skeptical reviewer verifies implementation matches spec exactly. Catches missing requirements AND over-building. Won't trust implementer's report—reads actual code.

2. **Code quality review** - Only runs after spec compliance passes. Reviews for clean code, test coverage, maintainability.

This catches the common failure mode where code is well-written but doesn't match what was requested. Reviews are loops, not one-shot: if reviewer finds issues, implementer fixes them, then reviewer checks again.

Other subagent workflow improvements:
- Controller provides full task text to workers (not file references)
- Workers can ask clarifying questions before AND during work
- Self-review checklist before reporting completion
- Plan read once at start, extracted to TodoWrite

New prompt templates in `skills/subagent-driven-development/`:
- `implementer-prompt.md` - Includes self-review checklist, encourages questions
- `spec-reviewer-prompt.md` - Skeptical verification against requirements
- `code-quality-reviewer-prompt.md` - Standard code review

**Debugging techniques consolidated with tools**

`systematic-debugging` now bundles supporting techniques and tools:
- `root-cause-tracing.md` - Trace bugs backward through call stack
- `defense-in-depth.md` - Add validation at multiple layers
- `condition-based-waiting.md` - Replace arbitrary timeouts with condition polling
- `find-polluter.sh` - Bisection script to find which test creates pollution
- `condition-based-waiting-example.ts` - Complete implementation from real debugging session

**Testing anti-patterns reference**

`test-driven-development` now includes `testing-anti-patterns.md` covering:
- Testing mock behavior instead of real behavior
- Adding test-only methods to production classes
- Mocking without understanding dependencies
- Incomplete mocks that hide structural assumptions

**Skill test infrastructure**

Three new test frameworks for validating skill behavior:

`tests/skill-triggering/` - Validates skills trigger from naive prompts without explicit naming. Tests 6 skills to ensure descriptions alone are sufficient.

`tests/claude-code/` - Integration tests using `claude -p` for headless testing. Verifies skill usage via session transcript (JSONL) analysis. Includes `analyze-token-usage.py` for cost tracking.

`tests/subagent-driven-dev/` - End-to-end workflow validation with two complete test projects:
- `go-fractals/` - CLI tool with Sierpinski/Mandelbrot (10 tasks)
- `svelte-todo/` - CRUD app with localStorage and Playwright (12 tasks)

### Major Changes

**DOT flowcharts as executable specifications**

Rewrote key skills using DOT/GraphViz flowcharts as the authoritative process definition. Prose becomes supporting content.

**The Description Trap** (documented in `writing-skills`): Discovered that skill descriptions override flowchart content when descriptions contain workflow summaries. Claude follows the short description instead of reading the detailed flowchart. Fix: descriptions must be trigger-only ("Use when X") with no process details.

**Skill priority in using-superpowers**

When multiple skills apply, process skills (brainstorming, debugging) now explicitly come before implementation skills. "Build X" triggers brainstorming first, then domain skills.

**brainstorming trigger strengthened**

Description changed to imperative: "You MUST use this before any creative work—creating features, building components, adding functionality, or modifying behavior."

### Breaking Changes

**Skill consolidation** - Six standalone skills merged:
- `root-cause-tracing`, `defense-in-depth`, `condition-based-waiting` → bundled in `systematic-debugging/`
- `testing-skills-with-subagents` → bundled in `writing-skills/`
- `testing-anti-patterns` → bundled in `test-driven-development/`
- `sharing-skills` removed (obsolete)

### Other Improvements

- **render-graphs.js** - Tool to extract DOT diagrams from skills and render to SVG
- **Rationalizations table** in using-superpowers - Scannable format including new entries: "I need more context first", "Let me explore first", "This feels productive"
- **docs/testing.md** - Guide to testing skills with Claude Code integration tests

---

## v3.6.2 (2025-12-03)

### Fixed

- **Linux Compatibility**: Fixed polyglot hook wrapper (`run-hook.cmd`) to use POSIX-compliant syntax
  - Replaced bash-specific `${BASH_SOURCE[0]:-$0}` with standard `$0` on line 16
  - Resolves "Bad substitution" error on Ubuntu/Debian systems where `/bin/sh` is dash
  - Fixes #141

---

## v3.5.1 (2025-11-24)

### Changed

- **OpenCode Bootstrap Refactor**: Switched from `chat.message` hook to `session.created` event for bootstrap injection
  - Bootstrap now injects at session creation via `session.prompt()` with `noReply: true`
  - Explicitly tells the model that using-superpowers is already loaded to prevent redundant skill loading
  - Consolidated bootstrap content generation into shared `getBootstrapContent()` helper
  - Cleaner single-implementation approach (removed fallback pattern)

---

## v3.5.0 (2025-11-23)

### Added

- **OpenCode Support**: Native JavaScript plugin for OpenCode.ai
  - Custom tools: `use_skill` and `find_skills`
  - Message insertion pattern for skill persistence across context compaction
  - Automatic context injection via chat.message hook
  - Auto re-injection on session.compacted events
  - Three-tier skill priority: project > personal > superpowers
  - Project-local skills support (`.opencode/skills/`)
  - Shared core module (`lib/skills-core.js`) for code reuse with Codex
  - Automated test suite with proper isolation (`tests/opencode/`)
  - Platform-specific documentation (`docs/README.opencode.md`, `docs/README.codex.md`)

### Changed

- **Refactored Codex Implementation**: Now uses shared `lib/skills-core.js` ES module
  - Eliminates code duplication between Codex and OpenCode
  - Single source of truth for skill discovery and parsing
  - Codex successfully loads ES modules via Node.js interop

- **Improved Documentation**: Rewrote README to explain problem/solution clearly
  - Removed duplicate sections and conflicting information
  - Added complete workflow description (brainstorm → plan → execute → finish)
  - Simplified platform installation instructions
  - Emphasized skill-checking protocol over automatic activation claims

---

## v3.4.1 (2025-10-31)

### Improvements

- Optimized superpowers bootstrap to eliminate redundant skill execution. The `using-superpowers` skill content is now provided directly in session context, with clear guidance to use the Skill tool only for other skills. This reduces overhead and prevents the confusing loop where agents would execute `using-superpowers` manually despite already having the content from session start.

## v3.4.0 (2025-10-30)

### Improvements

- Simplified `brainstorming` skill to return to original conversational vision. Removed heavyweight 6-phase process with formal checklists in favor of natural dialogue: ask questions one at a time, then present design in 200-300 word sections with validation. Keeps documentation and implementation handoff features.

## v3.3.1 (2025-10-28)

### Improvements

- Updated `brainstorming` skill to require autonomous recon before questioning, encourage recommendation-driven decisions, and prevent agents from delegating prioritization back to humans.
- Applied writing clarity improvements to `brainstorming` skill following Strunk's "Elements of Style" principles (omitted needless words, converted negative to positive form, improved parallel construction).

### Bug Fixes

- Clarified `writing-skills` guidance so it points to the correct agent-specific personal skill directories (`~/.claude/skills` for Claude Code, `~/.codex/skills` for Codex).

## v3.3.0 (2025-10-28)

### New Features

**Experimental Codex Support**
- Added unified `superpowers-codex` script with bootstrap/use-skill/find-skills commands
- Cross-platform Node.js implementation (works on Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Namespaced skills: `superpowers:skill-name` for superpowers skills, `skill-name` for personal
- Personal skills override superpowers skills when names match
- Clean skill display: shows name/description without raw frontmatter
- Helpful context: shows supporting files directory for each skill
- Tool mapping for Codex: TodoWrite→update_plan, subagents→manual fallback, etc.
- Bootstrap integration with minimal AGENTS.md for automatic startup
- Complete installation guide and bootstrap instructions specific to Codex

**Key differences from Claude Code integration:**
- Single unified script instead of separate tools
- Tool substitution system for Codex-specific equivalents
- Simplified subagent handling (manual work instead of delegation)
- Updated terminology: "Superpowers skills" instead of "Core skills"

### Files Added
- `.codex/INSTALL.md` - Installation guide for Codex users
- `.codex/superpowers-bootstrap.md` - Bootstrap instructions with Codex adaptations
- `.codex/superpowers-codex` - Unified Node.js executable with all functionality

**Note:** Codex support is experimental. The integration provides core superpowers functionality but may require refinement based on user feedback.

## v3.2.3 (2025-10-23)

### Improvements

**Updated using-superpowers skill to use Skill tool instead of Read tool**
- Changed skill invocation instructions from Read tool to Skill tool
- Updated description: "using Read tool" → "using Skill tool"
- Updated step 3: "Use the Read tool" → "Use the Skill tool to read and run"
- Updated rationalization list: "Read the current version" → "Run the current version"

The Skill tool is the proper mechanism for invoking skills in Claude Code. This update corrects the bootstrap instructions to guide agents toward the correct tool.

### Files Changed
- Updated: `skills/using-superpowers/SKILL.md` - Changed tool references from Read to Skill

## v3.2.2 (2025-10-21)

### Improvements

**Strengthened using-superpowers skill against agent rationalization**
- Added EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT block with absolute language about mandatory skill checking
  - "If even 1% chance a skill applies, you MUST read it"
  - "You do not have a choice. You cannot rationalize your way out."
- Added MANDATORY FIRST RESPONSE PROTOCOL checklist
  - 5-step process agents must complete before any response
  - Explicit "responding without this = failure" consequence
- Added Common Rationalizations section with 8 specific evasion patterns
  - "This is just a simple question" → WRONG
  - "I can check files quickly" → WRONG
  - "Let me gather information first" → WRONG
  - Plus 5 more common patterns observed in agent behavior

These changes address observed agent behavior where they rationalize around skill usage despite clear instructions. The forceful language and pre-emptive counter-arguments aim to make non-compliance harder.

### Files Changed
- Updated: `skills/using-superpowers/SKILL.md` - Added three layers of enforcement to prevent skill-skipping rationalization

## v3.2.1 (2025-10-20)

### New Features

**Code reviewer agent now included in plugin**
- Added `superpowers:code-reviewer` agent to plugin's `agents/` directory
- Agent provides systematic code review against plans and coding standards
- Previously required users to have personal agent configuration
- All skill references updated to use namespaced `superpowers:code-reviewer`
- Fixes #55

### Files Changed
- New: `agents/code-reviewer.md` - Agent definition with review checklist and output format
- Updated: `skills/requesting-code-review/SKILL.md` - References to `superpowers:code-reviewer`
- Updated: `skills/subagent-driven-development/SKILL.md` - References to `superpowers:code-reviewer`

## v3.2.0 (2025-10-18)

### New Features

**Design documentation in brainstorming workflow**
- Added Phase 4: Design Documentation to brainstorming skill
- Design documents now written to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md` before implementation
- Restores functionality from original brainstorming command that was lost during skill conversion
- Documents written before worktree setup and implementation planning
- Tested with subagent to verify compliance under time pressure

### Breaking Changes

**Skill reference namespace standardization**
- All internal skill references now use `superpowers:` namespace prefix
- Updated format: `superpowers:test-driven-development` (previously just `test-driven-development`)
- Affects all REQUIRED SUB-SKILL, RECOMMENDED SUB-SKILL, and REQUIRED BACKGROUND references
- Aligns with how skills are invoked using the Skill tool
- Files updated: brainstorming, executing-plans, subagent-driven-development, systematic-debugging, testing-skills-with-subagents, writing-plans, writing-skills

### Improvements

**Design vs implementation plan naming**
- Design documents use `-design.md` suffix to prevent filename collisions
- Implementation plans continue using existing `YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md` format
- Both stored in `docs/plans/` directory with clear naming distinction

## v3.1.1 (2025-10-17)

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed command syntax in README** (#44) - Updated all command references to use correct namespaced syntax (`/superpowers:brainstorm` instead of `/brainstorm`). Plugin-provided commands are automatically namespaced by Claude Code to avoid conflicts between plugins.

## v3.1.0 (2025-10-17)

### Breaking Changes

**Skill names standardized to lowercase**
- All skill frontmatter `name:` fields now use lowercase kebab-case matching directory names
- Examples: `brainstorming`, `test-driven-development`, `using-git-worktrees`
- All skill announcements and cross-references updated to lowercase format
- This ensures consistent naming across directory names, frontmatter, and documentation

### New Features

**Enhanced brainstorming skill**
- Added Quick Reference table showing phases, activities, and tool usage
- Added copyable workflow checklist for tracking progress
- Added decision flowchart for when to revisit earlier phases
- Added comprehensive AskUserQuestion tool guidance with concrete examples
- Added "Question Patterns" section explaining when to use structured vs open-ended questions
- Restructured Key Principles as scannable table

**Anthropic best practices integration**
- Added `skills/writing-skills/anthropic-best-practices.md` - Official Anthropic skill authoring guide
- Referenced in writing-skills SKILL.md for comprehensive guidance
- Provides patterns for progressive disclosure, workflows, and evaluation

### Improvements

**Skill cross-reference clarity**
- All skill references now use explicit requirement markers:
  - `**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:**` - Prerequisites you must understand
  - `**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:**` - Skills that must be used in workflow
  - `**Complementary skills:**` - Optional but helpful related skills
- Removed old path format (`skills/collaboration/X` → just `X`)
- Updated Integration sections with categorized relationships (Required vs Complementary)
- Updated cross-reference documentation with best practices

**Alignment with Anthropic best practices**
- Fixed description grammar and voice (fully third-person)
- Added Quick Reference tables for scanning
- Added workflow checklists Claude can copy and track
- Appropriate use of flowcharts for non-obvious decision points
- Improved scannable table formats
- All skills well under 500-line recommendation

### Bug Fixes

- **Re-added missing command redirects** - Restored `commands/brainstorm.md` and `commands/write-plan.md` that were accidentally removed in v3.0 migration
- Fixed `defense-in-depth` name mismatch (was `Defense-in-Depth-Validation`)
- Fixed `receiving-code-review` name mismatch (was `Code-Review-Reception`)
- Fixed `commands/brainstorm.md` reference to correct skill name
- Removed references to non-existent related skills

### Documentation

**writing-skills improvements**
- Updated cross-referencing guidance with explicit requirement markers
- Added reference to Anthropic's official best practices
- Improved examples showing proper skill reference format

## v3.0.1 (2025-10-16)

### Changes

We now use Anthropic's first-party skills system!

## v2.0.2 (2025-10-12)

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed false warning when local skills repo is ahead of upstream** - The initialization script was incorrectly warning "New skills available from upstream" when the local repository had commits ahead of upstream. The logic now correctly distinguishes between three git states: local behind (should update), local ahead (no warning), and diverged (should warn).

## v2.0.1 (2025-10-12)

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed session-start hook execution in plugin context** (#8, PR #9) - The hook was failing silently with "Plugin hook error" preventing skills context from loading. Fixed by:
  - Using `${BASH_SOURCE[0]:-$0}` fallback when BASH_SOURCE is unbound in Claude Code's execution context
  - Adding `|| true` to handle empty grep results gracefully when filtering status flags

# Superpowers v2.0.0 Release Notes

## Overview

Superpowers v2.0 makes skills more accessible, maintainable, and community-driven through a major architectural shift.

The headline change is **skills repository separation**: all skills, scripts, and documentation have moved from the plugin into a dedicated repository ([obra/superpowers-skills](https://github.com/obra/superpowers-skills)). This transforms superpowers from a monolithic plugin into a lightweight shim that manages a local clone of the skills repository. Skills auto-update on session start. Users fork and contribute improvements via standard git workflows. The skills library versions independently from the plugin.

Beyond infrastructure, this release adds nine new skills focused on problem-solving, research, and architecture. We rewrote the core **using-skills** documentation with imperative tone and clearer structure, making it easier for Claude to understand when and how to use skills. **find-skills** now outputs paths you can paste directly into the Read tool, eliminating friction in the skills discovery workflow.

Users experience seamless operation: the plugin handles cloning, forking, and updating automatically. Contributors find the new architecture makes improving and sharing skills trivial. This release lays the foundation for skills to evolve rapidly as a community resource.

## Breaking Changes

### Skills Repository Separation

**The biggest change:** Skills no longer live in the plugin. They've been moved to a separate repository at [obra/superpowers-skills](https://github.com/obra/superpowers-skills).

**What this means for you:**

- **First install:** Plugin automatically clones skills to `~/.config/superpowers/skills/`
- **Forking:** During setup, you'll be offered the option to fork the skills repo (if `gh` is installed)
- **Updates:** Skills auto-update on session start (fast-forward when possible)
- **Contributing:** Work on branches, commit locally, submit PRs to upstream
- **No more shadowing:** Old two-tier system (personal/core) replaced with single-repo branch workflow

**Migration:**

If you have an existing installation:
1. Your old `~/.config/superpowers/.git` will be backed up to `~/.config/superpowers/.git.bak`
2. Old skills will be backed up to `~/.config/superpowers/skills.bak`
3. Fresh clone of obra/superpowers-skills will be created at `~/.config/superpowers/skills/`
